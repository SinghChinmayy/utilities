- `caddy reload`  
  Reloads the Caddy service after changes to the `Caddyfile`.

- `caddy stop`

## Basic Caddyfile Syntax

```caddyfile
localhost {
    respond "Hello, world!"
}

localhost:2016 {
    respond "Goodbye, world!"
}
```

## Using Caddy with Tailscale

You can easily serve a static site or file server over your Tailscale network using Caddy.  
Just add your Tailscale hostname in the Caddyfile like this:

```caddyfile
[your-host-name].ts.net {
    root * /workspace/codes/sample_site/
    file_server
}
```

**Line-by-line breakdown:**
- `[your-host-name].ts.net`  
  This is your Tailscale machine's unique hostname. Replace with your actual Tailscale hostname (find it with `tailscale status`).
- `root * /workspace/codes/sample_site/`  
  Sets the root directory for your static site or files to serve.
- `file_server`  
  Enables Caddy's built-in file server to serve files from the specified root.

> **Note:**  
> The first time you load your Tailscale `.ts.net` address, it may take a little longer.  
> This is normalâ€”Caddy is acquiring a certificate for your Tailscale domain.

This setup is a simple way to share static sites or files securely across your Tailscale network with
